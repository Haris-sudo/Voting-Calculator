# Voting-Calculator

This repository is for CMP1903M (Object Oriented Programming)'s first assignment. Our job is to recreate the following calculator as a C# coding project.

https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/voting-calculator/.

At the very least, we will implement the ‘qualified majority’ voting rule and the ‘all countries participating’ rule, although other rules may be implemented. These will be implemented in a development branch of this repository. Additionally, we will work with a terminal-based application as opposed to Windows Forms due to inexperience. In the event of all features being completed, this is a development area that can be considered.

We are also required to use data abstraction and encapsulation as founding principles in our work. Additionally, other basic object oriented programming fundamentals such as class implementations, object instantiations and method calls must be utilised.
