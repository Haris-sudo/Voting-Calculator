CMP1903M - Object-Orientated Programming

Whilst there was no merit to using Windows Forms over a console application, I (Ethan) wanted to push forward and attempt to work on Windows Forms.

Whilst experimental, I have made good progress with this and as such, this branch rivals even the master itself.  All efforts were eventually shifted to this and as such, commits will be lacking from other contributors. Where commits are lost, this has been made up for in rigorous testing and UX design.

More details on this project can be found in the master branch.
