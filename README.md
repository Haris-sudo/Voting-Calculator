CMP1903M - Object-Orientated Programming

Whilst there was no merit to using Windows Forms over a console application, I (Ethan) wanted to push forward and attempt to work on Windows Forms.

Whilst experimental, I have made good progress with this and as such, this branch rivals even the master itself.  Please take both branches into consideration.

More details on this project can be found in the master branch.
